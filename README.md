# Resume-Builder-Application
Full Stack Web Development I | September 2025 - Present | Langara College

I am building a resume building application to help people build strong resumes. Users will input their contact information, job experience, education, which will then generate suggested formats for their resumes. Users can then download the resume as a pdf. The resume will have several sections, which will be: education, work experience, volunteer experience, academic/personal projects.

I will also make a cover letter application which can help users with making cover letters. Users will upload their resumes, hiring manager information, job they're applying for, and job qualifications, which will then generate an appropriate cover letter for the job. The cover letter will have several parts, including a personal interest in job/company, how the user meets the job qualifications, and thanks/closing remarks.
